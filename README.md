issues with dialogue in game. for some reason the dialogue options are not working.

Click talk-to on the npc (handleOption1 from NPC.java) but it is not calling the dialogue. Toward the end there is an else if - this prints 'notihng interesting happens'
if handleOption1 is not defined, it does not print that text when I activate handleOption1 in game.
